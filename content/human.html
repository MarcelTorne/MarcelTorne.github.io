          One day I thought it would be a good idea to do a Half Ironman, I still don't know if it was such a great idea haha but that's me in my first Ironman 70.3 triathlon in Nice, France 2023.

          After graduating from my Bachelors in 2021, I moved to the US to pursue my Masters at Harvard University. Every day I am trying to become a better researcher however, excirsing is a great way for me to take a break, rest my brain, be happy and come back more excited to my research. So I've started running :) This is me during my first Boston Half Marathon in the Fall 2022!

        In 2018, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my studies at EPFL. Since then, I have decided that I want to really focus on learning and studying. For this reason, I stopped competing in sailing. However, during academic breaks, I could enjoy the Swiss lifestyle hiking and skiing in the Alps.

        During my last two years of High School (2017-2018), I discovered my passion for learning and increased my focus on my studies drastically. I worked hard on my International Baccalaureate and Spanish Diploma exams, and I won a bronze medal in the 2018 Spanish Physics Olympiads. <br>

        Music has been a central part of my education. From 2008 to 2018, I was pursuing a Music Degree specialized in Barroque Guitar and Lute where I had the honor to learn from Professor William Waters. I also participated in chamber music and choir auditions <br>

        Between 2016 and 2018 I competed in a windsurfing modality called Raceboard, its characteristics are the big size of the sail and the long but thin board. I got to a pretty good level and won some trophies in regional championships<br>
