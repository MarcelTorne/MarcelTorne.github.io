          I am a Master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at <a>Harvard University</a> doing my thesis in Reinforcement Learning and Robotics at <a>MIT</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pulkitag/">Pulkit Agrawal</a> and Professor <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/">Abhishek Gupta</a>. My interest lies in building assistive robots to help the elderly in their daily life. To get there, we should advance the field in <a>generalizable and transferable robotic controllers</a> &mdash; one of my ideas is to bring <a>foundation models</a> from computer vision and natural language processing to robotics. 
          -->
          I am a PhD student at Stanford University.
          My dream is to design the next generation of learning-based assistive robots. I plan to get there by studying methods for scalable data collection and rapid adaptation of policies to unseen scenarios while emphasizing human-centric approaches.

          Previously, I obtained my Master's degree at Harvard University supported by the <a href="https://rcc.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Real Colegio Complutense</a> scholarship. And I was part of the Improbable AI Lab at MIT CSAIL under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pulkitag/" target="_blank">Pulkit Agrawal</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/" target="_blank">Abhishek Gupta</a>. 
          Even before that, I received my Bachelor&#39;s degree from <a href="">&Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a>, where I was lucky enough to do my bachelor's project at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/" target="_blank">MLO</a> and <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/igh-intelligent-global-health/" target="_blank">iGH</a> under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi" target="_blank">Martin Jaggi</a> and <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/mary-anne-hartley/" target="_blank">Mary-Anne Hartley</a> . There I started an open source platform, <a href="https://github.com/epfml/disco" target="_blank">DisCO</a>, for training ML models in a federated and decentralized fashion. I showed its usefulness training Computer Vision models for Healthcare.

          <p align='justify'>
            In industry, I have interned at <a>Microsoft Bing</a> and <a>Amazon Search</a> working on their ranking algorithms.
          </p>

        <p align='justify'>
          I spend my free time I running, sailing, and biking; playing the barroque guitar; or reading books.
